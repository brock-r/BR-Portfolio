### Data Analysis and Visualization

[Advanced Sport Statistics Social Media Project](https://github.com/brock-r/Data-Computer-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/AndNewAnalytics)
- Web Scraping advanced sport statistics using Python's Beautiful Soup library, extracting data from a variety of different website links. Organizing data into Pandas dataset for data cleaning and sport-related feature additions. The [Athlete Profiles]( https://github.com/brock-r/Data-Computer-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/AndNewAnalytics/Data%20Creation%20(web%20scraping%20and%20more)/Athlete%20Profiles.ipynb) file contains summary statistics of all fighters throughout their careers. The [Fight Statistics](https://github.com/brock-r/Data-Computer-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/AndNewAnalytics/Data%20Creation%20(web%20scraping%20and%20more)/Fight%20Stats.ipynb) file contains fight data from every UFC event. The data is managed within a PostgreSQL database. Python scripts are automatically run and implemented after each weekly event via Windows Task Scheduler.  Lastly, using photo editing tools such as photoshop to create relevant social media posts that can be found, including animated graphs and much more [here]( https://www.instagram.com/andnewanalytics/).

[UFC Title Contender Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/brock-r/BR-Portfolio/blob/master/Exploratory%20Analysis/UFC%20Contender%20Analysis.ipynb) 
- An exploratory data analysis of championship contenders in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). Including in-depth data cleaning and filtering, win totals, fight experience analysis for UFC fighters leading up to a title fight. With a dataset hosted on Kaggle using Python's Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Pandas libraries.

[Stock Data Analysis (Course Project)](https://github.com/brock-r/BR-Portfolio/blob/master/Exploratory%20Analysis/Finance%20Capstone%20Project%20.ipynb) 
- An exploratory data analysis of stock data from major stock companies ranging from 2008-2016. Including information on close price, daily returns, ect. data gathered from Kaggle, using Python's Seaborn, Matplotlib, iplotly, and Pandas libraries.

[911 Calls Analysis (Course Project)](https://github.com/brock-r/BR-Portfolio/blob/master/Exploratory%20Analysis/Data%20Capstone%20Project%20911%20Calls.ipynb) 
- Exploratory Data Analysis on 911 calls data, a look at reasons for 911 calls, popular months for calls, and other related topics. Data gathered from Kaggle, using Python's Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Pandas libraries.
